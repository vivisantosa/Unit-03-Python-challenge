To : graders and readers of these files :

Because I can't send the whole files and I am not sure if my file structure goes to github I will explain it here, so you can recreate it and run it well.

I have homework folder as the main folder with 3 subfolders : 
- Programs : where I put my python files
- Resources : where I put my input files
- Analysis : where I send my output files

I decided to put all the python programs together despite being asked to be put in different folders because I want it to be able to run together (which I enable through main.py file, which runs all my 4 python simultaneously. The programs can also be run individually as well. 

I also decided to do the extra challenge by running all the 3 paragraphs that being mention in the assignment (copying the one in the sample as paragraph_0.txt) for PyParagraph challenge - I send those file with my programs. 
I canâ€™t send the files for PyPoll and PyBoss because of github restriction - so please add those (election_data.csc and employee_data.csv) to the Resources folder.

Thank you and enjoy.
